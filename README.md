Bubble, Selection, Insertion sorts are my best attempts to create them from the pseudo code from the rosettacode.org website

Merge and Quick sort are straight copies of what rosettacode.org displays (permission from TA)

STL:sort is of course from the library stuffs

The Vector file (I forget which one) that implements the random vector generation has been slightly changed to enable random element vectors of multiples of 10 with the elements' values ranging from 1-500 inclusive.
